### Welcome to the VCT Hackathon: Esports Manager Challenge, powered by AWS and Riot Games!
You are hired as a data scientist on a new VALORANT Esports team and have been tasked by the team’s general manager to support the scouting and recruitment process. Create a LLM-powered digital assistant to build teams and answer various questions about VALORANT Esports players.

VALORANT is a tactical FPS by Riot Games, combining precise gunplay with unique agent abilities in a strategic 5v5 format. The VALORANT Champions Tour (VCT) is the official esports league for the game, featuring regional qualifiers, leagues, and culminating in a global championship.

Leveraging Amazon Bedrock’s generative AI capabilities, you will use provided data sources to demonstrate effective information retrieval and analysis, creating a digital assistant that enhances understanding of VALORANT’s dynamic esports scene.
